# Coffee Break Code - jQuery
## Week 1 - days 4 to 6

To continue on with the review for this week, here are some callback functions that you can try out. Run them on a web-based IDE, like repl.it to see it run instantly in the browser:
[Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/)
Search "JavaScript" in the top search bar to get started. 

### Notes about these JS exercises:

Fear not! I have not forgotten about practical exercises. Who knows, you might want a timer on your webpage, and these could come in handy. Next week will be a website with jQuery exercises that we build up. It is best if everyone understands what's going on with jQuery first, so that is why there is this review section. Same deal as last assignment. Do one question a day, but if you're on a roll, do them all in one sitting. 

### Remember to practise your GitHub skills by branching your cloned project

## Have Fun, and Happy Coding!
